### Expected Solution

**1. Automated Categorization and Prioritization**  
   - Integrate the system with the existing Rail Madad platform to streamline the complaint management process.  
   - **Image and Video Analysis**: Use AI-powered image and video recognition to categorize complaints like coach cleanliness, damage, and staff behavior.  
   - **Urgency Detection**: Assess the severity of complaints using visual content and prioritize urgent cases.  

**2. Enhanced Data Extraction**  
   - **Text Recognition (OCR)**: Extract textual information from images/videos (e.g., signage or documents) for more context.  
   - **Metadata Analysis**: Use timestamps and geolocation to provide additional context for resolution.  

**3. Automated Response and Routing**  
   - **AI Chatbots**: Provide instant acknowledgment and gather additional information from complainants.  
   - **Smart Routing**: Route complaints to the most appropriate department using AI algorithms.  

**4. Predictive Maintenance**  
   - **Issue Prediction**: Use machine learning models to predict recurring issues for proactive maintenance.  

**5. Feedback and Continuous Improvement**  
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze feedback sentiment to identify areas for improvement.  
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Continuously track and optimize the resolution process.  

**6. Training and Support**  
   - **AI-Assisted Training**: Help staff analyze and resolve complaints efficiently using AI tools.  
   - **Resource Allocation**: Dynamically allocate resources based on complaint patterns.

## 2. Issues in Current System and Our Solution

**Problems in Current System**  
- Complaints are manually categorized and routed, leading to delays in resolution.  
- No analysis of customer sentiment, urgency, or recurring issues.  
- Lack of effective processing for multimedia complaints (photos and videos).

**Our Solution**  
- Centralized AI-powered system for automated categorization, routing, and analysis.  
- Real-time sentiment and urgency detection.  
- Integration of multimedia processing capabilities.

---

## 3. Core Objectives

- Reduce complaint response and resolution time by 50%.  
- Simplify categorization and routing using AI for faster grievance redressal.

## 5. Methodology and Tech Stack

**Web Development**  
- Backend: Python (Flask)  
- Frontend: Next.js with Tailwind CSS  

**AI and Machine Learning**  
- Scikit-learn for models  
- Azure Cognitive Services for OCR  
- LangChain and Gemini for RAG operations and fine-tuning  

**Databases**  
- MongoDB Atlas Azure as the main database  
- ChromaDB for vector storage  

**Deployment**

---

## 6. Automated Routing Process

- Complaints are categorized by train and station.  
- Routed to TTE or Station Master, then forwarded to relevant departments.  
- If unresolved within 5-10 minutes, escalated to the Division Office.  
- Automatic rerouting if TTE declares an issue unsolvable.

## 9. Data Extraction

### 9.1 Data Extraction from Voice

- Using **DistilBERT**, a lightweight version of BERT.  
- Noise reduction ensures only customer content is processed.

### 9.2 Data Extraction from Text, Images, and Videos

- **YOLOv5** based on ResNet for object detection in images/videos.  
- Direct inputs from RailMadad's Twitter handle and app.

## 10. Complaint Resolution and Forwarding

- Complaints categorized by type are sent to TTEs.  
- TTEs receive dynamically generated steps for resolution using Gemini and Llama 2.  
- If unresolved, complaints are rerouted using natural language to appropriate departments.
