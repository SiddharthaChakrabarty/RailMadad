## Enhancing Rail Madad with Al-powered Complaint Management


## Problem Statement:

Expected Solution: 
1. Automated Categorization and Prioritization: 
Integrate the system with the existing Rail Madad platform to streamline the complaint management process. 
Image and Video Analysis: Use Al-powered image and video recognition to automatically categorize the nature of the complaint (e.g., coach cleanliness, damage, staff behaviour). 
Urgency Detection: Implement Al to assess the severity of the issue from visual content and prioritize complaints that need immediate attention. 
2. Enhanced Data Extraction: 
Text Recognition (OCR): Utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract textual information from images or videos, such as signage or documents, to gather more contexts about the complaint. 
Metadata Analysis: Extract metadata from images and videos (e.g., timestamp, location) to provide additional information for more accurate and quicker resolution. 
3. Automated Response and Routing: 
AI Chatbots: Deploy Al chatbots to provide instant acknowledgment and preliminary responses, collecting additional necessary information from the complainant. 
Smart Routing: Use Al algorithms to route complaints to the most appropriate department or official based on the content of the photos or videos. 
4. Predictive Maintenance: 
Issue Prediction: Implement machine learning models to predict recurring issues from the analysis of visual data trends, helping in proactive maintenance and reducing future complaints.
 5. Feedback and Continuous Improvement: 
Sentiment Analysis: Use Al to analyze the sentiment of feedback provided by complainants, identifying areas needing improvement. 
Performance Monitoring: Continuously monitor the effectiveness of the complaint resolution process through Al-driven analytics, making data-driven adjustments for process enhancement. 
Accuracy detection: Accuracy of Al-powered complaint detection can be analysed. 
Speed Analysis: Speed of complaint registration and resolution. ? User experience and satisfaction. 
Scalability and integrability with existing system. 
6. Training and Support: 
Al-Assisted Training: Provide Al-based training tools for staff to help them better analyze and resolve complaints efficiently using visual data. 
Resource Allocation: Use Al to analyze complaint patterns and allocates resources dynamically, ensuring that high-priority issues receive prompt attention. 



## Problem with current system and our Solution

Currently the RailMadad architecture is such that all complaints have to be manually categorized and then routed to the specific responsible department leading to delays in grievance resolution. 
There is no proper provision for analyzing customer sentiment, urgency & recurring issues. 
A significant portion of daily complaints includes multimedia files such as photos and videos, whose information needs to be extracted properly.
Our solution aims to provide a centralized platform for addressing all these issues using an AI powered categorization and routing system.


# Core objectives of our Project:

Our solution aims to reduce both the response and disposal time by half. 
Our aim is to simplify the categorization and routing process using AI based techniques to enable fast grievance redressal.
